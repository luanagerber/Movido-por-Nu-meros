## Movido por Números
This repository contains an iPhone app project made in SwiftUI, using Xcode.

### About
Movido por Números ("Driven by Numbers") is the first iPhone app I've created on my own. It was developed in SwiftUI, using the MVC software architecture.
In this interactive book the user has to solve mathematical expressions to generate fuel for a spaceship and thus progress through the story.
The spaceship symbolizes the journey of personal development of young Eduardo, who is looking for a professional path to follow.
